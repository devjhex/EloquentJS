/* A LIST */

/* Objects, as generic blobs of values, can be used to build all sorts of data structures. A common data structure is the list (not to be confused with array). A
list is a nested set of objects, with the first object holding a reference to the
second, the second to the third, and so on.
        let list = {
            value: 1,
            rest: {value: 2,
            rest: {value: 3,
            rest: null}
            }
                };

A nice thing about lists is that they can share parts of their structure. For
example, if I create two new values {value: 0, rest: list} and {value: -1,
rest: list} (with list referring to the binding defined earlier), they are both
independent lists, but they share the structure that makes up their last three
elements. The original list is also still a valid three-element list.
    Write a function arrayToList that builds up a list structure like the one
    shown when given [1, 2, 3] as argument. Also write a listToArray function
    that produces an array from a list. Then add a helper function prepend, which
    takes an element and a list and creates a new list that adds the element to the
    front of the input list, and nth, which takes a list and a number and returns
    the element at the given position in the list (with zero referring to the first
    element) or undefined when there is no such element.
If you havenâ€™t already, also write a recursive version of nth. */

function arrayToList(array){
    let list = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        
        list.value = array.splice(0,1)[0];
        list.rest = array.length>0?arrayToList(array):null;
        
    }
    return list;
}

/* list to array function */
function listToArray(list){
    let result = [];
    if (list === undefined || list.value ===undefined || list.rest === undefined){
        return result;
    }
    else {
        result.push(list.value);
           while (list.hasOwnProperty("rest") && list.rest !== null) {

            list = list.rest;

            result.push(list.value);
           }

        }

        return result;
    }



    /* prepend function */
    function prepend (element, list) {
        return {
            value:element,
            rest:list
        };
    }
    
    /* nth function */
    function nth (number, list){
        return listToArray(list)[number];
    }

    /* nth recursive function */
    function nthRecursive (number, list){
        if (number === 0) {
            return list.value;
        }
        else if (list.rest === null){
            return undefined;
        }
        else {
            return nthRecursive(number-1, list.rest);
        }
